After touring all 14 assets, the list was whittled down to 2 viable alternatives.  After the initial proposals were received from both Landlords, it was decided to focus on one asset, while working with the Landlord of RIM\u2019s clients location, and negotiating a strong deal that would meet all of RIM\u2019s primary criteria.  In the end, a 60 month lease was attained with RIM\u2019s ability to terminate in month 36 with a minimal penalty.  The first 12 months of the lease RIM would only pay on that portion of space related to their new clients needs (40,000 SF) while RIM was able to utilize the full 83,000 SF.  This new location was also 1.5 miles away from their main clients manufacturing facility.&#92;nTHE RESULT&#92;nRIM moved into their new facility on April 1, 2012.  In the end, Ginn Commercial Group along with The Modal Group was able to secure a lease rate that was 23% below the asking rate while securing lease concessions equal to $125,000 reduction in operating costs to RIM\u2014in the first year alone.  Additionally, we were also able to get the Landlord to construct a climate controlled room of 3,000 SF within the warehouse at their sole cost.

Equally important, the company wanted it in a Milwaukee submarket where available land for development was very limited.&#92;n&#92;nTHE APPROACH&#92;nHighly active in the local market, First Industrial Realty Trust knew of a vacant land parcel in Waukesha County whose corporate owner was seeking to sell.  The 55 acre site, of which Quad/Graphics would take 22 acres was just a few miles from Quad/Graphics exisiting facility.  The site provided ample room for the construction of a 388,800 s.f. cross-dock facility that would deliver 49 loading docks, trailer storage and increase from their current facility by nearly 60%.&#92;n&#92;nFirst Industrial&#39;s team understand that another key requirement for the company was to secure a funcitonal facility at a reasonable cost.  Having built several warehouses for corporate customers across the region, First Industrial leveraged its development expertise and local relationships to ensure the facility came in on time and on budget.&#92;n&#92;nTHE OUTCOME&#92;nBy building a central facility to cross-dock product and consolidate storage of paper and finished goods, Quad/Graphics is creating a more efficient and rapid supply chain.

A 600,000 s.f. facility expandable to 850,000 s.f. was designed to give the company the flexibility to accommodate a possible supply chain reconfiguration.&#92;n&#92;nWorking hand-in-hand with Rustoleum to meet a critical move-in deadline, First Industrial leveraged its local relationships to secure tax-increment financing for infrastructure costs.  Moreover, the team worked with all levels of government to obtain a fire code variance for storage of flammable and combustible paints - saving the company significant fire-proofing expense.&#92;n&#92;nTHE OUTCOME&#92;nHaving engaged a provider known for creative problem-solving, Rustoleum benefited from a TIF that lowered its lease rate and gained a DC that will enable it to close outmoded facilities, immediately increase capacity by 40 percent and ensure faster, more efficient delivery of its famous paints to retailers nationwide.', u'title': u'Rustoleum DC BTS'}, {u'timePeriod': u'2011.4 ~ 2012.1', u'description': u'THE CHALLENGE&#92;nInternational distributor of wire and cabling  materials needed to consolidate their Southeastern Wisconsin operations from 3 locations into 1 in order to provide quality and economic advantages to one of their larger customers.

From this list our team selected 5 candidate buildings based on a selective criteria.   After this tour Request for Proposal (RFP\u2019s) were sent to all 5 selected assets and the best candidate was chosen.

The &#92;nLandlord would construct a new property within a 6 month window and Anixter would lease this Landlord\u2019s existing assets, rent free, during the &#92;nconstruction process.  An aggressive lease rate along with a generous tenant improvement package was negotiated and a lease was executed within 2 months after the initial site search began.&#92;nTHE RESULT&#92;nAnixter moved into their new 61,000 SF home on January 1, 2012.  In the end, from our initial inquiries into the cost of space, Ginn Commercial Group was able to reduce Anixter\u2019s rent by 7% while negotiating not only a 20% higher Tenant Improvement allowance but also alleviated their lease termination by securing space rent free during the construction phase, an additional savings of nearly $140,000.  The Landlord won in the end as well as the remaining space within their 180,000 SF speculative warehouse was filled three months after Anixter moved in.&#92;n', u'title': u'Anixter'}]",[],"[u'Construction Management', u'Investment Properties', u'Leases', u'Contract Negotiations']","Well rounded professional in the commercial real estate industry having managed, leased, developed, and invested in retail, office and industrial real estate.

From 2005-2007 I taught: Human Biology, Anatomy, Physiology and Botany. After 2007 I decided to take a hiatus from teaching and focus on raising my small children who are now older and in school full time.

This calls for an infrastructure able to collect, store, query, and process data set from sensor networks. The design and development of such infrastructure faces several challenges. The first group of challenges reflects the need to interact with and administer the sensors remotely. The sensors may be deployed in inaccessible places and have only intermittent network connectivity due to power conservation and other factors. This calls for communication protocols that can withstand unreliable networks as well as an administrative interface to sensor controller. Further, the system has to be scalable, i.e., capable of ultimately dealing with potentially large numbers of data producing sensors. It also needs to be able to organize many different data types efficiently. And finally, it also needs to scale in the number of queries and processing requests.&#92;nIn this work we present a set of protocols and a cloud-based data store called WaggleDB that address those challenges.

It deals with pages (blocks) of fixed size (PAGE_SIZE). It has also to provide methods for creating, opening, and closing files. It has to maintain several types of information for an open file: The number of total pages in the file, the current page position (for reading and writing), the file name, and a POSIX file descriptor. &#92;n&#92;n2.&#92;tBuffer Manager: &#92;nImplement a buffer manager that manages a buffer of blocks in memory including reading/flushing to disk and block replacement (flushing blocks to disk to make space for reading new blocks from disk).

Essentially, it processes a S3 or Swift request and fetches the requested object from the backing object store (RADOS). RGW uses multiple threads to service incoming requests concurrently. In practice, object access exhibits a fair degree of temporal locality. Thus, to improve performance, I am implementing a caching layer using lock-free hashtable powered by lock-free skip list for small objects (where small is &lt;1MB, basically small enough to fit comfortably in memory).&#92;n&#92;nThe other work is to separate CRUSH from Ceph so as to be reused by other systems, e.g. ZHT/FusionFS. With power of CRUSH, these systems will be topology-aware(e.g. node, rack, room and datacenter).

As the system scales to thousands of thousands nodes, this does not really work well because lock-based membership synchronization is heavyweight and could cause system hiccup and even unexpected fault. So we have to design and implement protocols used to efficiently manage consistency of shared information (e.g. configuration and dynamic membership) in overlay network model. Nested consensus based Paxos Grouping is our idea from these outstanding works.&#92;n&#92;n1. Scatter (SOSP\u201911) is one of ideas. Grouping nodes, making the group autonomic with help of paxos. Group talking to group to exchange information based on two-phase commit distributed transaction. This sounds promising at least based on this paper&#39;s benchmark. &#92;n&#92;n2. Distributed coordination service (e.g. Chubby OSDI&#39;06) with group management is another way, however, I doubt its ability to manage thousands of thousands of nodes because Chubby cells fail to dynamically expand or contract.&#92;n&#92;n3. Distributed B-tree combines the two avenues, e.g. B-tree node is a group of computer nodes with shared information; Subtree rooted at a node forms one group that synchronizes information to another group formed in the same way.

This project makes the&#92;nfollowing contributions to the current state of the art. First, we propose and develop a fully distributed Protocol for Frequent Item set Discovery (ProFID) where the result is produced at every peer. ProFID uses gossip-based (epidemic) communication, a novel pairwise&#92;naveraging function and system size estimation together to discover frequent items in an unstructured P2P network. We also propose a practical rule for convergence of the algorithm. In contrast to the previous works, each peer gives local decision for convergence based&#92;non the change of updated local state. We developed a model of ProFID in PeerSim and performed various experiments to compare and evaluate its efficiency, scalability, applicability. The protocol\u2019s resilience under realistic churn models was studied. For evaluating the&#92;neffect of network dynamics, we deployed our protocol on the Internet-scale real network PlanetLab. We also compared the accuracy and scalability of ProFID with adaptive Push-Sum algorithm. Our results confirm the practical nature, ease of deployment and efficiency&#92;nour approach, and also show that it outperforms adaptive Push-sum in terms of accuracy, convergence speed and message overhead.&#92;n&#92;nSee more details at http://www.utdallas.edu/~emrah.cem/software.html', u'title': u'A fully distributed Protocol for Frequent Item set Discovery (ProFID)'}, {u'timePeriod': u'2011.11 ~ 2011.11', u'description': u'In this project, a customized multicast data distribution application is implemented. The application consists of two parts: (i) A Streaming host, (ii) User clients. Data are distributed to all clients either directly by the streaming host or forwarded by other clients. You can think this as a multicast tree structure of nodes being rooted at the streaming host. Node i has bandwidth capacity ki , meaning it can send/forward data to only ki other nodes. In other words, Node i can have up to ki children in the tree. Each node may have different values for streaming capacity (k \u2265 2). New nodes are added to&#92;nthe system by satisfying the above constraint and doing breadth-first search over the tree in order to get a parent. The nodes in the system communicate with others via TCP connections until it gets a parent whereas all subsequent data streaming are done using UDP packets. Periodically, the root node tries to minimize the longest distance to the leaves of the tree. For this, first the root acquires&#92;nthe knowledge of the complete tree and computes an optimal tree structure of minimal depth. Then, the root node schedules node-shuffling (one by one) in order to complete the re-configuration of the tree. A node (not root) may arbitrarily leave the system either after notifying its parent and children or it may just crash (without notification). In such cases, the tree structure should be restored in such a way that the bandwidth constraint should not be violated.&#92;n&#92;nProject Description can be found at http://www.utdallas.edu/~emrah.cem/utd_course_projects/CS6390-ACN/Project.pdf&#92;n&#92;nSource code can be downloaded from http://www.utdallas.edu/~emrah.cem/utd_course_projects/CS6390-ACN/emrah_cem_ACNProject.zip', u'title': u'Multicast based Data Distribution Application (in Java)'}, {u'timePeriod': u'2012.2 ~ 2012.2', u'description': u'In this project, a basic network design model which finds the minimum cost network is implemented.

This paper proposes a reconfigurable switch architecture which is capable of operating in four configurations with different levels of reliability. This is done by the use of a local configuration controller logic which is fully protected against transient faults. When a controller detects a high error rate situation, it configures the switch to a high reliability mode and vice versa. Reconfiguration policy is designed in a way which minimizes the imposed performance and power overheads to the switch. Evaluations are done by a cycle accurate NoC simulator with Orion patch for power estimation. Simulation results show a noticeable reliability improvement with an eligible performance overhead.

Bacteria frequently encode more than one sortase enzyme and an even larger number of potential sortase substrates that possess an LPXTG-type cell wall sorting signal. In order to elucidate the sorting pathways present in gram-positive bacteria, we performed a comparative analysis of 72 sequenced microbial genomes. We show that sortase enzymes can be partitioned into five distinct subfamilies based upon their primary sequences and that most of their substrates can be predicted by making a few conservative assumptions. Most bacteria encode sortases from two or more subfamilies, which are predicted to function nonredundantly in sorting proteins to the cell surface. Only \u223c20% of sortase-related proteins are most closely related to the well-characterized Staphylococcus aureus SrtA protein, but nonetheless, these proteins are responsible for anchoring the majority of surface proteins in gram-positive bacteria.

Written Arabic dialects, unlike MSA, has evolving standards and has different morphological and grammatical rules from MSA, which require different approaches.&#92;n&#92;nThis project aims to bridge the gap between MSA and Arabic dialects, by providing a framework for Arabic dialect classification. We present LAHGA, an Arabic dialect classifier that can classify three different dialects with high recall and precision. These dialects include the Egyptian dialect, the Levantine dialect, and the Maghrebi dialect. We used manually extracted features for machine learning and rule-based classification. Tweets were the main source for our training and testing data which has several advantages like being very close to the daily language but introduces different kind of challenges such as noisy data. Despite these problems, LAHGA performed very well exhibiting an F1-measure upto 0.75 on noisy random data and 0.9 on manually selected data. Herein, we present our efforts to build such a classifier and directions for future work.&#92;n&#92;nThis project was implemented as part of the Information Retrieval course and was well received by the instructor (Prof James Martin).', u'title': u'LAHGA: Arabic Dialect Classifier'}, {u'timePeriod': u'2009.9 ~ 2009.12', u'description': u' In this project we implement four optimization techniques that we integrated within our compiler:&#92;n&#92;nFirst, we implemented type specialization since checking code eats up a big portion of the execution time and degrades the performance of the processor. By eliminiating the extra code we greatly improved the performance of our compiled code to 5x its original run-time.&#92;n&#92;nSecond, we eliminated indirect calls since they are quite expensive and are unnecessary in several cases. By removing these indirect calls, we achieved an improvement of 4% and with type specialization the improvement can reach 21%.&#92;n&#92;nThird, we replaced the compiler instruction target from x86 assembly code with LLVM intermediate representation (IR) and leveraged several optimization techniques within the LLVM optimizer. The optimized LLVM code reduced our program execution time by an average of 83%. Additionally, the LLVM target code is portable and can be easily compiled for most computer systems and architectures.&#92;n&#92;nFinally, we integrated within our compiler a garbage collector since memory allocation is one of the most time consuming operations in our compiled code. By implementing a more efficient   memory allocation and deallocation we achieved twice the performance of using malloc, on average.', u'title': u'Compiler Optimization Techniques'}, {u'timePeriod': u'2013.9 ~ now', u'description': u'Lyme disease is one of the fast-growing diseases in the US, in fact it is the fastest growing vector-borne disease. Statistics shows a prevalence of 34% in one study and upto 62% in a specialty clinic located in an area endemic for Lyme disease. It spreads through ticks and are confused with several other diseases especially in the early phases.  The exact definition of the infection still remains controversial and  lab tests currently employed by CDC (Center of Disease Control), the two-tier test, has a sensitivity of 64% and can not  distinguish between acute, chronic, or resolved infection.&#92;n&#92;nCurrently, physicians and specialist depend on detailed list of patient history to detect the infection, and figure out which category (bite tick) the patient has been exposed to. The methodology is still under development and highly depends on the specialist experience with other patients. Moreover, the treatment plan, which depends on the diagnosis, is also under development and takes long periods of times to improve the patient&#39;s symptoms.&#92;n&#92;nIn this project, we aim to using data mining tools to develop a systematic methodology to detect and diagnose the infection. Leveraging an anonymous data set of  patients&#39; history, we plan on setting up a diagnosis methodology and treatment plan based on similar patients in the data set.&#92;n&#92;nCurrently, this project is in its early phases and not much results are available.

A simpler problem that was studied in this project was navigating through an unexplored maze and finding the path to the center. No information was given about the layout of the maze. The only information known beforehand is the number of cells that comprise the maze. This problem was one of IEEE contests called Micromouse.&#92;n&#92;nMicromouse is a synthesis of electrical, mechanical, and software sub-systems that integrate to provide an autonomous robot. The electrical part comprise the micro-controller, drivers, and sensors. It is a complete embedded system with real-time computing and stringent power constraints. The mechanical part comprises the chasis, wheel steering, and weight analysis. Finally, the software system is comprised of real-time sensor monitoring, real-time control of motor speed and direction, and real-time analysis of the maze to discover the location and shortest path to the center.&#92;n&#92;nThe real challenge in this project was how to build this system with local components (in Egypt) with very low cost while maintaining an acceptable speed and solution time. We were able to build this robot with tens of dollars and it worked as part of our Capstone project in Cairo University in 2003.

Chameleon ART offers a migration tool for analog IP cores that preserves circuit and layout topologies. The automated process extracts features and domain knowledge of the analog design and migrates it to the new technology with the same characteristics. This process is done in two steps: (1) The first steps involves calculating the new device dimensions for the new technology, (2) Step two compacts the layout dimensions while satisfying the new technology DRC rules. The output of this process is a new circuit and layout topology of the IP core in a new technology that perserves domain knowledge in the original design including symmetry, hierarchy, and placement and routing while leveraging new advantages of the new technology like smaller area and lower power.&#92;n&#92;nChameleon ART is a SW tool started in Mentor Graphics Egypt as a R&amp;D project and has developed into a product.

This network will scale for use in thousand core chip systems. At the physical level, SoI-based adiabatic coupler has been designed to provide low-loss and compact optical power splitting. Based on the adiabatic coupler, a topology based on 2-ary folded butterfly is designed to provide linear power division in a thousand core layout with minimal cross-overs. To address the network agility and provide for efficient use of optical bandwidth, a flow control and routing mechanism is introduced to dynamically allocate bandwidth and provide fairness usage of network resources. At the system level, bloom filter-based filtering for localization of communication are designed for reducing global traffic. In addition, a novel greedy-based data and workload migration are leveraged to increase the locality of communication in a NUCA (non-uniform cache access) architecture.

Pipelines can be scheduled, reused as templates and run in batch or streaming mode. All the pipelines, the execution flow, ETL, steps and configuration is done via a secure REST interface using JSON objects. Banzai opens the big data development space to all development languages, without being familiar with MapReduce, streaming, data patters and algorithms. All Banzai components (pipelines, pipeline instances, sources, sinks, steps, streaming, etc) are built, tested and glued together - the only thing an application developer has to do is to take these predefined building blocks and assemble pipelines of executions flows using a REST interface.

Used two methods for texture mapping. One was texture on model, This  method  aims  to  color  points  of  the  model  in  the  world  space  before  view transformation. After the model is construct, we iterate the model\u2019s width, height and depth to get the point on the model orderly. Since the walls in the model is large enough, we begin by dividing each surface into several small polygons. For each small polygon, we use the unit image to map it by applying the vertices in world coordinate to match the pixels in the texture coordinate produced by the aiming image. After that, we read the pixels\u2019 RGB information that has already stored and then assign the information to the corresponding point.In this method, z-buffer is used to decide the position of the maze image. Since we are mapping with each point, we must determine which points are in the front and which are not expected to appear in the screen since some points front block them. &#92;nAnother method was mapping the triangles. In the construction step, we construct the wall surface polygon by jointing small triangles. The second mapping method is to color each triangle after the coordinate transformation. For those will not be shown on the screen, we do nothing. On the other side, if a triangle will appear in the screen range, we just map it. Here we use a barycentric system algorithm to get the point position in the texture coordinate by given a point position in the triangle. The unit image is a polygon, to map a triangle we just use half part of it. So that before we apply the barycentric algorithm, we determine which triangle the point is in and then take the referring coordinate.&#92;n', u'title': u'3-D Maze Game, Computer Graphics course project'}]",[],"[u'Scala', u'SQL', u'Linux', u'Java']","Have more than 4 years‘ experience in programming and software development using different coding languages, especially expert in JAVA. &#92;nHave good knowledge about database, networks and cloud computing and used to work on different systems such as windows and Linux.

We taught ourselves Sqoop, Pig, Hive, Spark, then Scala, Cascading, then Scalding... we&#39;ve used Streams to pipe data into custom Scala and C# applications for analysis. We started orchestrating data imports using Oozie, and after finding out the hard way how horribly inflexible and difficult it is to work with - started developing our own automation / scheduling framework in Scala.&#92;n&#92;nThat was about 6 months ago - now we have significant knowledge not only about how to interact with the Hadoop ecosystem on both a Dev Ops level, but also on the API / programmatic level. We have a robust, full featured, declarative scheduling framework in Scala that does everything Oozie can do, and much more.

Researchers have been active in exposing the flaws of various P2P networks that emerged in the last decade and many solutions were also incorporated to enhance the privacy and protection of the P2P users. However, with the dynamically changing architectures and policies of the P2P networks, newer issues, like botnets, are now on the rise. Botnets in the recent times are seen to increase their survivability and to conceal the identities of their operators by employing P2P technology using Command and Control mechanism. This thesis focuses on studying the research so far in this area of P2P Privacy &amp; Security and developing countermeasures for preserving the privacy of the users in the P2P network and augmenting the work of an Intrusion Detection System, to detect predict attacks relevant to P2P networks in real-time, specifically that of Botnets.&#92;nTwo Approaches have been chosen for this study.

By comparing the bid prices along with other significant bid variables, FLAG is able to establish invaluable benchmarks for detecting future bid-rigging. The contractor who submits the lowest bid price will win the contract of road construction. &#92;nDuring the project, we tried to fit an appropriate regression model for predicting low-bid price. Our idea was to eliminate the irrelevant factors and build a regression model with the most significant variables. The model should be able to provide FLAG with useful information on the range of bidding prices. Therefore, our modeling process had three main steps: initial exploration of the data, regression model selection, model analysis and testing. The final model measures the change in price for every one-unit increase in each variable when the other independent variables in the model are held fixed. The predication and estimation values of the final model are also very close to real value for each trial. So FLAG will be able to use this model to get a range of estimation and prediction of bidding prices. The fair or competitive price of a contract should be in the range.

Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) are focusing on how to position their products as a service. Before deciding to offer traditional license mode, pure Software as a Service (SaaS) mode, or a dual mode, the ISV must factor in product readiness considering the existing and prospective user base, as well as new investments that must be made to achieve the desired delivery mechanism. The ISV should also understand the competitive price points for the products offered through different delivery mechanisms, especially as compared with generally lower entry price points offered byproducts offered only as SaaS. It is also important to factor in investment for scalability in the SaaS model since customers expect on-demand additional resources during their peak consumption periods.&#92;nTo deliver Software as a Service (SaaS) ISVs typically work with either ready cloud services offered by Amazon, Microsoft, Google or Salesforce.com (force.com) or rent some data center space offered by infrastructure hosting companies.

This allows an organization to achieve a very high server to admin ratio (1 admin to 500+ os instances), reduce the amount of hardware required to provide services to endusers with out reducing SLA on those services, reduce the power &amp; cooling foot print of local data centers and reduce cpu/memory/network/storage IO in public cloud environments.

Although the VI team siad they could accomindate this request, it was highly suggested to use physical hardware for two reason : one we do not have the store avaiable from a VM prespective and secondly it does not introduce an new complexity to the current configuration. It seems to be a simplier solution to cutover existing SAN, rather than move that much data to a New Data Volume.&#92;n&#92;nHad CASNET meeting with Brad and Larry Jezior, application does support Windows 2008, however there are several other componenets to the environment.

Hi all, We discovered that the problem was multiple instances of TCPClient running, due to 2 Remote Desktop sessions, that connected without using the \u201cConsole or Admin\u201d switches. Both instances of the TCPClient were trying to talk to the same port on the Medina end of the connection. This is probably what was generating the connection errors, too.

And, I dig deeper than the stated need. Hearing about the context -- the policies, the system constraints, etc. -- typically lets me come up with a different point of view than others have had.  That view often leads to a significant simplification of identity and access administration, as well as other improvements. The benefits are usually immediately apparent -- which is a source of delight for the client, and a good feeling for me! &#92;n&#92;nSee more about how I can help at acknowledgesoftware.com .&#92;n"

There are two types of instances: negative instances, which are found in either negative bags or positive bags, and positive instances, which are found only in positive bags. While a positive bag should contain at least one inherently positive instance, a negative bag must not contain any positive instances. In MIL, labels are not available at the instance level. It is interesting to note however that the label space is the same for both at the bag level and at the instance level. One may attempt to learn instance-level labels during the training stage, thus reducing the problem to an instance level supervised classification. Alternatively, one may also localize and prototype the positive instances in the feature space and rely on the proximity to these prototypes for subsequent classification.&#92;n&#92;nMIL is an ideal set-up for many computer vision tasks. In particular, MIL can be an especially suitable model for medical image-based pathology classification and lesion detection localization, where an image is labeled pathological just because of one or a few lesions localized to small portions of the image. Medical images collected in a clinical setting may readily have an image-level label (either normal or various levels of pathology) while lacking the exact location of the lesion(s). The figure above illustrates such an example: color fundus images of eyes affected with different pathologies of diabetic retinopathy (DR). It is easy to notice that, although majority of the image looks normal, a small retinal landmark is enough to alter the label of the image from normal to pathological. In a MIL formulation for this problem, each image can be considered a bag and patches of images can be considered instances.&#92;n&#92;nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;oaclw6_JYyo&#92;n', u'title': u'Multiple Instance Learning'}, {u'timePeriod': u'2015.12 ~ 2015.12', u'description': u'yann: version 0.0.1a1&#92;n&#92;nAn even easier, simpler and versatile CNN tool alternative to Lasagne and Keras.&#92;nPromotes easy learnability and practice of CNNs using theano.&#92;nModular and plug and play modules and layers.&#92;nImplementations of most commonly used techniques and popular papers in CNN research.&#92;n&#92;nOriginally written for personal research, this toolbox will be most useful for those who are interested in starting deep CNNs to make a fast transition into theano and developing CNNs.

In a consensus based state  estimation framework, multiple neighboring nodes iteratively communicate with each other, exchanging their own local estimates of a target\u2019s state with the goal of converging to a single state estimate over the entire network. However, the state estimation problem becomes challenging when a node has limited observability of the state. In addition, the consensus estimate is sub-optimal when the cross-covariances between the individual state estimates across different nodes are not incorporated in the distributed estimation framework. The crosscovariance is usually neglected because the computational and bandwidth requirements for its computation grow exponentially with the number of nodes. These limitations can be overcome by noting that, as the state estimates at different nodes converge, the information at each node becomes redundant. This fact can be utilized to compute the optimal estimate by proper weighting of the prior state and measurement information. Motivated by this idea, we propose information-weighted consensus algorithms for distributed maximum a posteriori parameter estimates, and their extension to the information-weighted consensus \ufb01lter (ICF) for state estimation. We show both theoretically and experimentally that the proposed methods asymptotically approach the optimal centralized performance. Simulation results show that ICF is robust even when the optimality conditions are not met and has low communication requirements.', u'title': u'Distributed Single-Target Tracking (ICF Algorithm)'}, {u'timePeriod': u'2012.6 ~ 2012.6', u'description': u'Due to their high fault-tolerance, ease of installation and scalability to large networks, distributed algorithms have recently gained immense popularity in the sensor networks community, especially in computer vision. Multi-target tracking in a camera network is one of the fundamental problems in this domain. Distributed estimation algorithms work by exchanging information between sensors that are communication neighbors. Since most cameras are directional sensors, it is often the case that neighboring sensors may not be sensing the same target. Such sensors that do not have information about a target are termed as ``naive&#39;&#39; with respect to that target. In this paper, we propose consensus-based distributed multi-target tracking algorithms in a camera network that are designed to address this issue of naivety. The estimation errors in tracking and data association, as well as the effect of naivety, are jointly addressed leading to the development of an information-weighted consensus algorithm, which we term as the Multi-target Information Consensus (MTIC) algorithm. The incorporation of the probabilistic data association mechanism makes the MTIC algorithm very robust to false measurements/clutter.
