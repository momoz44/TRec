I worked with Dr. Mohamed Zohdy on a project about a new spyware detection solution.&#92;n&#92;nWe believe the issue with modern anti-spyware systems is the need to manually update the system&#39;s database of spyware definitions when a new or modified trace of spyware surfaced. Our solution is to accomplish an automatic detection and removal process by using data mining and machine learning techniques. We analyze the existing spyware and benign samples through data mining and find their common and specific features. Then, we train our application through machine learning algorithms to classify samples as spyware or benign, and categorize samples within spyware on a severity spectrum. &#92;n&#92;nOur work was presented at the Mid-Michigan Symposium for Undergraduate Research Experiences (MID-SURE) at Michigan State University in July 2015. Our research paper, \u201cApplication of Hybrid Machine Learning to Detect and Remove Malware\u201d, was published in the journal of Transactions on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (TMLAI: ISSN 2054-7390) Volume 3, Issue 4, in August 2015.', u'title': u'NSF REU: Application of Hybrid Machine Learning to Detect and Remove Malware'}, {u'timePeriod': u'2015.8 ~ now', u'description': u'My senior design group was selected as one of the eight finalist teams to compete in the 2016 RASC-AL Exploration Robotics Tele-Operations Competition (RoboOps).

The rover\u2019s objective is to collect small, colored rock samples at NASA Johnson Space Center&#39;s Rock-yard while being remotely tele-operated by drivers at our mission control.&#92;n&#92;nThe core of the rover framework is designed in ROS (Robot Operating System). My team created the rover&#39;s motor control system for movement, pick-up, and release actions. We also designed a networking system to allow long distance communication between the rover and mission control, so data such as sensor readings and audiovisual feeds can be transmitted. In addition, we interfaced two USB-cameras to provide stereo vision from the rover, and used the Real-Time Appearance-Based Mapping approach to generate a 3D map of the rover&#39;s surroundings.', u'title': u'Senior Design: Teleoperated Rover Design for NASA&#39;s RASC-AL Robo-Ops Competition'}, {u'timePeriod': u'2016.5 ~ 2016.8', u'description': u'In the summer of 2016, I was selected to attend the Research in Interactive Virtual Experiences REU program (NSF grant No. IIS-1560426) at University of Southern California - Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) in Playa Vista, California. I worked with Dr. David Pynadath and Dr. Ning Wang on a multi-agent simulation project.&#92;n&#92;nUsing ICT&#39;s social simulation framework, PsychSim, we created a team of autonomous agents that can work together toward a scenario. The scenario we designed involved a group of military soldiers trying to explore a goal area without being captured by enemy soldiers, all acting autonomously. In addition, we included additional decision-making agents such as a military base or helicopter that aid the soldiers in their task. We found that by changing the reward functions of the agents, we can give them a personality: e.g. an agent that takes longer to reach the goal for the sake of personal safety and avoiding enemies has a timid personality. By looking at these teamwork models and relationships between the agents, we design a learning model for the agents to change their behavior through experience. In the future, we hope to simulate how training and feedback strategies interact with agents and the learning models, and anticipate presenting our findings at a conference.', u'title': u'NSF REU: Multi-agent Simulation of Team Training'}, {u'timePeriod': u'2014.8 ~ 2014.12', u'description': u'Our final project in Artificial Intelligence class was an agent that successfully plays Atari 2600 games through a platform called The Arcade Learning Environment and the Atari 2600 emulator Stella.

However, researchers often treat DNNs as black-boxes and the challenge remains in understanding what actually occurs internally in these networks. Our research is aimed at better understanding how DNNs work by visualizing which features neurons learn. We start with a randomly-generated image (similar to TV static) and continually optimize it in way that increases the activation of the target neuron. The resulting images tells us what a neuron has learned to fire in response to. Occasionally, images created from this process are unrecognizable to humans - which shows that there is still a big difference between computer and human vision. To address this issue, we impose biases in the optimization function so that the image looks more like natural, human-recognizable images (e.g. surrounding pixels should be similar in color). Studying these optimization biases are important factors to further understanding how DNNs work and improving DNNs.&#92;n&#92;n', u'title': u'NSF EPSCoR: Improving Our Understanding of Deep Neural Networks Through Better Visualization'}]","[{u'publisher': u'Transactions on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence', u'name': u'Application of Hybrid Machine Learning to Detect and Remove Malware'}, {u'publisher': u'In submission, pre-print available on arXiv', u'name': u'Assessing Retail Employee Risk Through Unsupervised Learning Techniques'}]","[u'Python', u'C++', u'Artificial Intelligence', u'Machine Learning']","Resume/CV: richard-yang.com/files/ryangcv.pdf&#92;n&#92;nMy experience and interests are in Machine Learning (deep neural networks and unsupervised learning), Artificial Intelligence (partially-observable Markov decision processes), and Robotics (motion planning and autonomous control)."

The primary tool of Bayesian optimization is the Gaussian process, which permits one to define a prior belief, which is then transformed into a posterior through sequential sampling of points. Unfortunately, Gaussian process interpolation suffers from a major computational bottleneck that makes it prohibitively expensive to use in large-scale optimization routines. In this work, we investigate deep neural networks for learning a representation of the space for which a much less computationally expensive interpolation algorithm may be used. Our implementation adaptively updates the representation of the neural network as more data becomes available over time. Since this neural network-based approach is parallelizable, we are able to exploit simultaneous function evaluation and network parameter learning. We show that this neural network-based approach leads to many of the same appealing properties of Gaussian processes, and which scales only linearly in the number of observations ceteris paribus.&#92;n    &#92;nWe additionally seek to provide a theoretical explanation regarding why an optimization algorithm of this form functions at all. For this, we develop a probabilistic theory of martingales and apply it to a performance metric for the neural network-based approach to Bayesian optimization. We find that the performance of the deep neural network is consistent with the predictions of our probabilistic theory. We therefore speculate on the kind of representation that is learned by the network in its final hidden layer. We additionally show that our approach is easily extended to a distributed environment, which results in faster optimization.

AURORA is funded by IARPA\u2019s ALADDIN program (Automated Low-level Analysis and Description of Diverse INtelligence video), which aims to combine expertise in video extraction, audio extraction, knowledge representation, and search technologies in a revolutionary way, to create fast, accurate, robust, and extensible technology that supports the multimedia analytic needs of the future.&#92;n&#92;nThe AURORA team at ICSI focuses on the audio extraction aspect of the project; researchers at ICSI have been developing state-of-the-art techniques for using audio analysis to detect the occurrence of specified events  (e.g., birthday party, bike trick, wedding cerimony, etc.) in videos.

A distributed microphone network is installed in the rooms of a house in order to monitor selectively acoustic and speech activities observable inside any space, and to eventually run a spoken dialogue session with a given user in order to implement a service or to have access to appliances and other devices. The multi-microphone front-end is based on the use of arrays consisting of analog microphones or Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) digital microphones. The targeted system analyses the given multi-space acoustic scene in a coherent way, by processing in a parallelized fashion simultaneous activities which occur in different rooms, and in case by supporting at the same time the interaction with users who may speak in different areas of the house.&#92;n&#92;nThese very challenging objectives require advances in different scientific and technical fields. In fact, based on the given network of microphone arrays, multi-microphone front-end processing includes, among the others, tasks as speaker localization, acoustic echo cancellation, speech enhancement, acoustic event segmentation and classification. It is then necessary to have robust technologies for distant-speech recognition and speaker identification (and verification).

While running a linear regression, it is assumed that there is a linear relationship between regressand and regressor variables and this relationship is additive. Various regression algorithms are used for modeling a data set using linear functions as well as estimating the unknown model parameters from data. The Recursive Least Square(RLS) algorithm is one of the most popular regression analysis methods with extremely fast convergence rate. But a regression analysis method does not perform well if the analysis is performed based on a set of observations representing only a small portion of independent input variables of the system. If a set of agents collaboratively read the observations of a system, then agents can also perform regression analysis collaboratively, i.e. by sharing all their readings and then forming an estimate. But in some systems, the agents are unwilling to share their observations due to privacy reasons, but do not mind sharing estimates with others for getting similar estimates in return. To this end, a RLS based distributed regression algorithm is developed for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) whereby sensors exchange local estimates with one-hop neighbors for consenting on the network-wide estimates adaptively and thereby converging to the estimates formed by a regression analysis based on all observations. The proposed algorithm has been obtained through recasting of the weighted linear least-squares cost into a separable form. Numerical simulations demonstrate that for a higher number of 1 hop neighbors, this RLS based distributed regression algorithm implementation by an agent performs similarly to the RLS algorithm based on full information.&#92;n&#92;nIndian Academy of Sciences summer research fellowship at TIFR Mumbai&#92;n&#92;nAdvisor: Dr. Onkar Dabeer', u'title': u'Distributed Linear Regression Under Privacy Constraints'}]","[{u'publisher': u'IST Lisbon/ master&#39;s thesis', u'name': u'Secure Dynamic Reconfiguration of FPGAs'}, {u'publisher': u'IEEE 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL 2014)', u'name': u'Secure partial dynamic reconfiguration with unsecured external memory'}, {u'publisher': u'Springer Jounal: Network Modeling Analysis in Health Informatics and Bioinformatics', u'name': u'Big Data Analytics in Bioinformatics: Architectures, Techniques, Tools, and Issues'}, {u'publisher': u'ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems', u'name': u'Compact and on-the-fly secure dynamic reconfiguration for volatile FPGAs'}]","[u'C', u'Machine Learning', u'Computational Neuroscience', u'Computer Vision']","Introductory: &#92;nI develop brain-inspired neural network models to perform perception/recognition tasks on neuromorphic hardware platforms.&#92;n&#92;nDetailed:&#92;nI am a PhD student in Computer Science at University of California, Irvine (UCI).

Samples are extracted from this region to serve as future training data to iteratively label the new incoming unlabeled drifting data. Once initialized, this approach never needs labeled data, and can indefinitely track the changes in data distribution. &#92;n&#92;nThe primary intellectual merit is a new framework, addressing arguably one of the most challenging learning problems, accomplished by strategic integration of machine learning and computational geometry. Significant fundamental knowledge will be obtained through formal development of this framework, which will then benefit many real-world applications, currently not properly addressed under existing approaches. &#92;n&#92;nBroader Impacts: The proposed framework promises to bring us closer to truly adaptive and intelligent (brain-like) learning, and allow proper analysis of data drawn from aforementioned scenarios, whose applications include network intrusion, cyber security, web-usage analysis, natural language processing, anomaly detection, climate change and energy demand analysis. Project&#39;s educational component will form Integrated Research and Learning Communities, drawing undergraduate students to whom this field has been mostly inaccessible.&#92;n&#92;n', u'title': u'Learning from Initially Labeled Nonstationary Streaming Data (NSF Funded)'}]","[{u'publisher': u'IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems', u'name': u'Bootstrap based Neyman-Pearson test for identifying variable importance'}, {u'publisher': u'Computational Biology and Chemistry', u'name': u'Information-theoretic approaches to SVM feature selection for metagenome read classification'}, {u'publisher': u'IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine', u'name': u'Learning in Nonstationary Environments: A Survey (Winner of Best Paper Award)'}, {u'publisher': u'IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience', u'name': u'Multilayer and recursive neural networks for metagenomics classification'}, {u'publisher': u' IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems', u'name': u'A Sequential Learning Approach for Scaling Up Filter-Based Feature Subset Selection  View Document'}, {u'publisher': u'IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering', u'name': u'Incremental Learning of Concept Drift from Streaming Imbalanced Data'}, {u'publisher': u'Pattern Recognition', u'name': u'Learn++.MF: A random subspace approach for the missing feature problem'}, {u'publisher': u'IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks', u'name': u'Incremental Learning of Concept Drift in Nonstationary Environments'}, {u'publisher': u'IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems', u'name': u'COMPOSE: A Semi-Supervised Learning Framework for Initially Labeled Non-Stationary Streaming Data'}]","[u'Bioinformatics', u'Neural Networks', u'Signal Processing', u'Machine Learning']","Conduct externally funded research in computational intelligence, machine learning, biomedical diagnostics, engineering education.&#92;n&#92;nTeach undergraduate and graduate courses in pattern recognition, signal processing, probability and statistics.&#92;n&#92;nTeach custom designed courses for companies, institutions in my areas of expertise.&#92;n&#92;nSpecialties: Machine learning, pattern recogntion, computational intelligence, data fusion, neural networks, bioinformatics, signal processing, wavelets."

To study the patterns of collaboration, we analyzed the co-author network (CAN) of scientists who conducted research in NSE. Further, we studied the structure of the information flow through the paper citation network (PCN) of papers authored in NSE. We constructed the two networks based on the publication data collected for years, ranging from 1993 to 2008, from the scientific literature database \u2018\u2018Web of Science\u2019\u2019. We explored these networks to find out whether they follow power-law (PL) degree distributions. The results showed that in spite of their high heterogeneity in terms of node degree, the CAN and the PCN of NSE do not strictly follow a PL degree distribution. We presented a comparison of goodness of fit of alternative distributions with the PL, and found out that the CAN, PCN-in-degree and PNC-out-degree sequences are well-fit by a PL form with an exponential cut-off. We observed that the CAN of scientists and the PCN of publications in the NSE have small-world characteristics with an average shortest path close to six between any two scientists and eight between any two publications. Moreover, we detected that the CAN is highly clustered whereas the clustering coefficient of the PCN is low compared to those of many real-world networks. Major communities of the giant components of the two networks are identified via community structure detection algorithms. The network characteristics indicated that the NSE research is performed by a small number of large communities and a large number of small communities. The leanness of connectivity across the communities shows that the papers mostly reference the publications within their community and rarely reference papers from other communities.', u'title': u'The Structure and Analysis of Nano Science and Engineering Co-author and Citation Networks'}, {u'timePeriod': u'2007.2 ~ 2007.5', u'description': u'Real-time driving simulators, which are virtual driving environments (VDEs), have been widely used to investigate driver behavior and psychophysiological responses. The design of realistic weather conditions and roads is a crucial part of building VDEs. Part of my studies towards receiving my Master of Science degree in Computer Systems Engineering was focused on building a three-dimensional VDE via using object-oriented techniques. We developed a software framework for the easy implementation of driving simulator scenarios in the Virtual Environments Laboratory of NU. The VDE was designed and implemented using a spline technique that serves as paths for autonomous vehicles.  We incorporated the spline technique with multi-resolution modeling, as well as paging of huge terrains, for fast rendering and for simulating realistic weather conditions. &#92;nTriggers, which are rules to regulate the behaviors of autonomous vehicles, were widely used in this project. The trigger points that placed on splines used for autonomous vehicle decision making, such as to accelerate, to decelerate, to wait at lights and signs, and to disappear from lines of sight.

In our study, we identified the significant and independent risk factors of falls among elderly people living in community centers. We analyzed the influence and effect of these factors on the probability of fall in community-dwelling older adults by applying appropriate statistical methods. We developed a predictive model that estimates the probability of a future fall and predicts the time window of the occurrence of the next fall. In our model, different factors that may be associated with falls were analyzed via logistic regression (LR) and ANNs approaches. We studied and compared the two methods to increase the understanding of fall risk factors, and thus decrease the number of falls among elderly by specifying more accurate predictors of falls.&#92;nAccording to the analysis, the most significant predictor in LR analysis is found to be the variable of \u2018lost balance within the past year\u2019. Other significant predictors are strokes, dizziness/fainting, falls within the past 30 days, and the number of supplements/vitamins used. The LR model has a prediction accuracy of 76.6% while an ANN model has 73%. The ANN model is expected to provide a more robust computational model than the LR to analyze past falls and predict future ones. However our research results are contrary to these expectations.

Previously, the unpredictable nature of SCs is studied using equation-based approaches, traditional simulation based approaches, or a combination of both. However, these modeling approaches fall short of capturing the dynamics of the complex adaptive nature of the SCs. Therefore, we developed an agent-based simulation model (ABSM) of a realistic computer manufacturing enterprise ecosystem (CMEE) to gain insights into the behavior of enterprises and interactions in their SCs. The model studies the influence and the effect of decisions and actions of computer manufacturing enterprises (CMEs) and their customers. It observes the changing trends in this environment and effects of those trends on market life expectancy and performance measures. &#92;nSpecifically, in this study we accomplished the following: (1) an accurate comprehensive model for observing the effect of market mechanisms on the CMEE, (2) a demonstration of the use of ABSM to study the evolution and self-organization of the CMEE, (3) a statistical and network analysis of the ABSM, (4) observation of evolutionary paths to understand the adaptation and collaboration mechanisms in the CMEE, and (5) the construction of methodologies and tools for agile, aligned and adaptive CMEs.', u'title': u'Analyzing and interpreting the complex structure, the scale free features and the patterns of complex networks and studying complex adaptive systems using agent based simulation approach, Network Theory approach, and NetLogo.'}, {u'timePeriod': u'2014 ~ 2014', u'description': u'In December 2013, Kalibrate was awarded a subcontract for \u201cRetail Marketing Analysis for Hydrogen Refueling Stations\u201d by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC management and operating contractor for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
