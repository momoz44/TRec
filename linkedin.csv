This application will be an extreme help to those going for Hajj (Islamic Pilgrimage where there are millions of people yearly) because it allows two much needed features. It allows you to save your location and, by means of a compass, it will show you the direction to the saved location until you reach. This will be extremely needed in places like Mina where you will stay in a tent and there will be thousands of other tents. Trust me when I say it is easy to get lost. With this application you can save the location of your tent, for example, and you wont have to worry about getting lost. &#92;nThe other mandatory feature is tracking people. One thing is to lose the way to your tent, but another is to get separated from a group member of family member. It is not easy to find each other although you may call each other and try to explain due to the huge crowd and lack of landmarks. Now, with this application, you can easily send your location to another person which, when received, will set your location in their phone and direct them right to you. Obviously this feature of tracking people REQUIRES mobile service. Also this application uses the hard ware in your phone, namely the compass and GPS. So it will only function as good as the hardware in your phone. Also, if it is too cloudy to establish connection, you can turn off your GPS and use cell towers to get your location. I really hope this will help all the people who are going this year for Hajj and make their Hajj easy. I intend to publish it atleast a couple months before hajj seasons.
