Novel coupling of socio-linguistic and network analysis will be used to identify important persons and objects, statistical and factual knowledge about traffic and transportation networks, and their impact on hazard models (e.g. storm surge) and flood mapping.

The October 2014 Pew Research survey shows that 73% of adult Internet users have observed online harassment and 40% have experienced it. Most of those who have experienced online harassment, 66% said their most recent incident occurred on a social networking site or app. Further, 25% of teens claim to have been cyberbullied.

Harassment is a pragmatic phenomenon, necessarily context-sensitive. We identify three dimensions of context for social media, people, content, and network, for the harassment phenomenon.

The book is based on longitudinal research on migrants and squatters over four generations. The Foreword is by former Brazilian President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso. In 2005 Dr. Perlman was awarded The John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship.  For her fieldwork she received two Fulbright Awards and grants from The World Bank, The Tinker Foundation, The Ford Foundation and several bi-lateral agencies.

He also assists clients with recovery in cases of fraud, and is experienced with using the bankruptcy and fraudulent conveyance laws to do so. Julian advises emerging companies, executives, and artists on litigation matters, including real estate litigation, alternative dispute resolution, corporate formation and governance issues, shareholder relationships and agreements, intellectual property rights and related considerations, competition, and general employment matters, and serves as general counsel to several businesses. His clients include financial institutions; fashion manufacturers and retailers; consumer goods manufacturers and retailers; real estate owners and operators; high net worth individuals, entrepreneurs, and other investors; producers, filmmakers, photographers, illustrators, and other visual artists; and non-profit entities and trade associations.  &#92;n&#92;nJulian endeavors to work with his clients to resolve their disputes without resort to litigation whenever possible. Importantly, while many business disputes comes down to money, Julian is particularly adept at handling matters where interpersonal dynamics have been the primary impediment to a resolution.  When litigation becomes inevitable, Julian has unique experience working on matters, on behalf of both plaintiffs and defendants, which have gone all the way and been decided by judges, juries, or arbitrators.

I advocate automated code testing, disciplined test-first development, and risk-managed refactoring.

The migration needed to be done in a way that would 1) preserve existing change history, and 2) allow every developer and other repository user to make his personal migration at his own speed and at the most convenient moment. For this purpose I selected the tool SubGit [http://www.subgit.com/] which copied the whole Cxense Sweden Subversion repositories and created their equivalent Git repositories. Then SubGit set up server side hooks in both repositories which copied every change from one repository to the other exactly at the moment when it was done. We run both repositories in parallel for four months during which all developers finished their projects in Subversion and started new ones in using Git.&#92;n&#92;nDuring the migration period I provided training, wrote instructions to company wiki and taught Git to developers. I moved the server side hooks from Subversion to Git and programmed some new hooks, including hooks to protect the repository from branch rewrites, to force company policy on commit messages, and integration with JIRA. I selected the Perl Git::Hooks [http://gnustavo.github.io/Git-Hooks/] framework as basis for our hooks. I also programmed an installation script to allow developers to install the same hooks locally, thus preventing unnecessary push failures. The same system .git-repo-admin [https://github.com/mikkoi/.git-repo-admin] is used both for server side and local hooks. I gave a speech at Nordic Perl 2014 about .git-repo-admin (slides [http://www.slideshare.net/MikkoKoivunalho/githooks]).&#92;n&#92;nI have written an essay about how the choice of revision control system fosters (or is the result of) choices in project lead and administration: Revision Control and Project Culture [http://www.koivunalho.org/blogs/exercises-in-integration-and-delivery/revision-control-and-project-culture.html].&#92;n&#92;nPerl, Bash, Python, Git, Git::Hooks, Carton, Plenv, SubGit, JIRA.', u'title': u'Migration from Subversion to Git'}, {u'timePeriod': u'2015.8 ~ 2015.8', u'description': u'The legacy system had business logic, database calls and program flow all mixed together.

As computer-related technologies improve, users have the ability to generate higher resolution content. Creating backups becomes less feasible as the amount of data grows; limited network bandwidth makes the backup process cumbersome, and access to a large amount of storage space for backups is either limited or expensive. We propose a new P2P backup system, BTBackup, where users use each other as backup locations. The capacity of each user&#39;s physical storage is the only limiting factor for how much they can back up.

I worked as a developer from 2008 until July 2016 and was most recently part of the OS group. We design, develop, test, deploy, monitor, maintain, and support every project we work on. I&#39;ve watched the industry move away from completely separate departments for test, development, PM, and operations, and I&#39;ve watched quality continuously improve. For several years now, we (at Microsoft along with much of the industry) have moved away from long specification documents, to even longer documentation, and deployment docs that should&#39;ve been printed with a hardback cover. &lt;-- Preferably as an example of how-not-to do it. Developer&#39;s roles have expanded to include responsibilities from each of the previous departments. Engineers work directly with the business and interact directly with the end users. Engineers are given problems to solve, rather than a specification for how to solve a problem they don&#39;t even know about. Whether you&#39;re an engineer working on the project level, or feature, deliverable, or task level, we&#39;re given a problem to solve. We work individually or in small groups within their areas of expertise to design a solution, weighing different options, and make proposals to the team (teams are small. 7 people is a pretty full feature team). The team reviews the designs together at the deliverable level and designs are refined before code is written. Then we sprint. The longer you can work with a team, the more momentum you build, the team gets in a groove, and there&#39;s little that can stop them. We&#39;ve overcome a lot. We&#39;ve inherited projects that threw more than 100,000 errors / day. We&#39;ve designed entire service catalogs together and built them from the ground up.&#92;nI mostly worked on services and am most familiar with C#, ASP.NET (WebAPI, MVC, and classic), along with azure storage, service bus, and service fabric. &#92;nI loved it all, but mostly enjoyed helping others design and fix things, so I do that full-time now."

Thief should hide from her site by hiding behind curtains or under the table, whenever she passes by or else he is busted.

I came to the US three years ago to earn my Bachelor&#39;s Degree at MIT.&#92;n&#92;nI have a a variety of interests. I have a strong passion for Computer Science, especially Software Development. I discovered my passion my freshman spring at MIT, when I found myself glued to my laptop screen working on my Intro to Programming problem sets for 8+ hours straight at a time. As I kept taking more and more CS classes, I found myself doing the same thing, and I enjoyed the classes immensely. I especially found that I loved designing and implementing functional, beautifully written and bug-free software. This January (2016), I got more experience in software development at MIT&#39;s Web Programming Competition, where I learned Web Development, and again found myself spending 8+ hours straight every day, sometimes forgetting to eat, working on my website. As the year progressed, I took on more and more projects, some in classes (like my User Interface Design and Implementation class, and now my Software Studio class), and some I took on as research projects under PhD students at MIT. In the future, I want to keep creating software, especially ones that help the world.&#92;n&#92;nBut I also have some very organic goals I am extremely passionate about. I want to also start a project to help provide access to education for primary school age children, especially in South Asian countries such as India, Pakistan and my home country, Bangladesh. I am very passionate about the topic of sexism (and any other type of minority-discrimination). I strongly feel that these aggressions and biases stem from unquestioned stereotypes and assumptions children are subject to early on in their lives. So, I want to develop programs or camps that teach children critical thinking, not only in math or science, but also in their lives, so that they can question these assumptions and hopefully come out as more informed, more accepting human beings.&#92;n"

It&#39;s about leveraging the Internet of Things to make lives easier, and help people age in place.

An entrepreneur, writer, speaker and futurist, Randy accurately predicted the geometric growth rate of AWS. He is an advocate for open source technology as a foundational business model element in companies traditionally tied to proprietary models. Notably, Randy has initiated and led successful open sourcing efforts for several traditional ISVs. He was declared a top 10 cloud pioneer by InformationWeek &amp; Digital Influencer by Forbes.&#92;n&#92;nRandy was among the first to articulate the technological and cultural drivers that defined the success of hyperscale cloud as a segment of the global IT spend. He correctly identified the 30-year megatrend shifts from mainframe to client/server to cloud, and in the process popularized the pets vs. cattle meme as a construct for describing the fundamental difference between how enterprise stacks and cloud stacks are managed. In the process he coined “cloud scale” or “cloudscaling” as a descriptor for how cloud stacks differ.&#92;n&#92;nA pioneer and early, vocal advocate for the OpenStack project, Randy identified the devops and agile development movements as fundamental disruption forces that redefined the roles and relevant skill sets in enterprise IT leadership. Randy’s advocacy and public speaking have resulted in over 300,000 views and 5,000 downloads of his cloud and IT presentations on slideshare.&#92;n&#92;nHe led teams that achieved numerous cloud firsts, including the first public cloud in Korea, the first global carrier NFV cloud, and the first “cattle cloud” for a Fortune 5 company. Randy led the charge as change agent and expert disruptor within EMC, beginning with open sourcing of products, followed by the launch of the first mass-production OpenStack-powered appliance. He founded Cloudscaling, acquired by EMC in 2014. At EMC, he runs a strategic R&amp;D team focused on developing open source contributions and elevating the visibility of EMC as an open source player."

I used RabbitMQ to intercept messages from the Nova service. Now, OpenStack ceilometer service does a very good job in this regard.

Their techniques to commit financial crime can bypass or overcome compliance based systems.  And where the risk of defeating compliance programs is too high, organised crime penetrates an organisation in other ways, either by corrupting existing staff or corrupting students and graduates who are seeking employment particularly in financial institutions before they gain employment.  Institutions with weak employment vetting process, especially where that function has been outsourced are vulnerable.   HR staff, internal auditors and AML/CFT staff not trained in financial crime techniques (particularly money laundering &amp; corruption) may not identify the methods used and expose an organisation to greater risk &amp; potential loss.  Combining an effectiveness based solution with a compliance program enhances the internal controls of an organisation and target hardens it against crime.  Malkara Consulting delivers training designed to achieve a high level of effectiveness.&#92;nThere are a number of Australian AML/CTF however only Malkara Consulting can claim to have:&#92;n1.

On to Norfolk, Virginia, where I was stationed aboard the US 2nd Fleet Flagship, the USS Mount Whitney. The UNIX operating system, with HP-UX 9-10.x, and SunOS 5.6 installations &amp; archiving were my bread &amp; butter, and utilized advanced GUIs on the UNIX platform for systems and application administration.

Our customers were shuttle and space station pilots and specialists. My clause in the TSC contract ended on September 14, 2001. After some pure IT (subcontracting) work, I moved to Wisconsin and signed up for the Navy Reserves. In March of 2003 I was recalled to active duty twice receiving high awards for database creation and special projects which included database design, training, &amp; implementation. I ended my military service in March of 2009 while still working on my BS degree in MIS, graduating in December from Cardinal Stritch University. In January 2011 I began a career in the Central Texas Veterans Health Care System as an Information Technology Specialist (Customer Support).

I provided photography and web dev services while learning. In January 2015 I rejoined the VHA at the Harry S. Truman Memorial VA Hospital in Columbia, Missouri."

I have led projects across platforms in industries such as fashion &amp; retail, hi-tech, fintech, gaming and automotive.&#92;n&#92;nI have led and structured design teams and worked closely with global directors to define strategy and design processes within organisations. &#92;n&#92;nI am always on the look for innovation opportunities that involve new tech and need a holistic knowledge of UX strategy, omni-channel and end-to-end journey thinking. Believing that for any new technology, the fundamentals of user-centred design apply, I am always keen to bring my breadth of knowledge and experience to less traditional briefs. I am a keen follower of latest tech in the fields of voice, wearables and context aware computing."

Strings or resources are usually maintained in a special database as a center point of reference for all stake holders (developers, QE engineers, Product managers, Vendors, etc.). Given a particular product, we need to find a way to automate the mapping between images and resources. I used Robot Framework and Selenium web driver library to navigate the product and take screenshots. Assuming the localization automation in place can generate locales with only resource ID instead of pure English text then we can get the HTML source of the page using Selenium then extract a clean text using some specialized library (for example NLTK for Python). Now we have a text file containing the resource IDs along with a screenshot. Next we can search the text file using regular expressions and produce a map between that image and the extracted resource IDs. The final step is to notify back end that this image is associated with these IDs. Once that is done then we have a localization string database along with contextual preview screenshots. On top of that we are currently building a web application to pull translated text along with contextual screenshots so that users can suggest better translation or vote on existing translation.

In this project, I implemented a visual UI automation framework to test Vungle iOS SDK. The SDK fetches an MP4 video from an Ad server, plays the cached Ad and displays a download web view. Behind the scenes, there is a communication channel between the SDK and the server to report user activity. For the server piece, I replaced it with a mocking server using web.py. This gives the flexibility to simulate server responses that the SDK consumes. It also facilites testing the networking piece of the SDK. The framework consists of a setup script that fetches the latest iOS code from github, build it locally, launch the iPhone simulator and deploy the test app all from the command line.

Not only that, the actual fun starts when such button is localized to some foreign languages or when the destination page look and feel is different from the standard page. (2) Switching between country app stores requires to enter the right credentials. (3) Handling pops when errors happen or when accessing an app in the wrong country app store.

The application was literally rebuilt from from the ground up on both front and back end. Jquery and Jquery UI were used on the front end to provide modern GUI (main menu with cool animation effects and tooltips, navigation panel using Jquery accordion, smooth DOM updates using AJAX, themes switcher, auto complete from database, type writer effect welcome page, etc). The back end code was implemented using CodeIgniter MVC based PHP framework (The main GUI was split into multiple views, database access was implemented through models and various controllers to link data models to views). Full web service support was implemented with both JSON and XML output format. My favorite side of the whole redesign is the reuse of CodeIgniter controllers to implement web services.

In this project, I wanted to test the SDK integration so I built my own iPhone app. The app simulates a game integrating our SDK. It starts in camera view with a custom heart shape frame overlay. The scene shows inside the frame and when the user takes the photo, a GPU pixel shader blends the background image and the camera image generating a beautiful heart like frame. For example, user face inside a heart frame with roses background. When the user choose to save the image to disk the app says you can not do that unless you watch a Vungle video Ad.
